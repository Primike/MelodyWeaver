This is my melody weaver app. 

It allows users to create melodies and play them with different instruments and tempos. Users can save the melodies and edit them. 

Originally I wanted to have the audio play some sounds fast forwarded but quickly found out that the pitch was being distorted so I found and used Audiokit to fix that problem. The package is complex so I took some time to make sense of what was going on. 

I could continue to enhance this project by adding other more advanced Audiokit features like chords or distortions in the future.
